Steps to run using the zip folder
    - extract the contents of the zip 
    - open a new terminal 
    - cd into the cnn_toy_project folder extracted by the zip file
    - on windows run 'project_env\Scripts\activate' in the terminal on linux run 'source ./project_env/Scripts/activate' to activate the virtual environment
    - to run the training loop run 'python train.py'
    - to run the inference on the pre-trained model run 'python inference.py'

Steps to run using github (python 3.7 must be installed on system to run using this method)
    - clone the repository from https://github.com/Tanayk7/keras_shape_classifier using the zip download or by running 'git clone https://github.com/Tanayk7/keras_shape_classifier.git'
    - create a new virtual environment inside the cnn_toy_project directory by running 'python -m venv <your_env_name>'
    - on windows run '<your_env_name>\Scripts\activate' in the terminal on linux run 'source ./<your_env_name>/Scripts/activate' to activate the virtual environment
    - install dependencies using 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
    - to run the training loop run 'python train.py'
    - to run the inference on the pre-trained model run 'python inference.py'
